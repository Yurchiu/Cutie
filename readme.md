# Theme Cutie

![](https://yz-hs.github.io/img/intro4.jpg)

Here is the [Chinese version](https://yz-hs.github.io/39e4c172e542/). Chinese version is not identical to this.

## Background

This is the version 2.0 of theme cieuka.

**I am not working on it. I will get down to it in summer vacation.**

In order to learn relevant knowledge and make a good-looking theme, I made this. The layout of the theme is mainly based on [handsome](https://www.ihewro.com/archives/489/), a typecho theme. Most of the codes were originally programmed by me, while the rest were from the Internet.

## Install

You can install it by running this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yz-hs/cutie.git
```

## Usage

Firstly, you need to set the value of `theme` in the blog configuration file (`/path-to-your-blog/_config.yml`) to `cutie` to enable this theme.

Then, you need to read some documents (under `/path-to-the-theme/_doc`) to further configure the theme and learn more about this theme. Most of them are in Chinese.

**This topic relies on some plug-ins. Please be sure to read the document `/_doc/front-matter.md` first.**
